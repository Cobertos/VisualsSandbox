# Visuals Sandbox for Unity3D

Tools and sandbox environment for making music visuals in Unity3D. Provides nice interfaces and debugging visuals for BPM sources, Time and Frequence space data, etc...

originally based on [my similar experiments/toolkit for THREE.js](https://github.com/Cobertos/MIDI-Experiment)

### Usage 

1. Download or clone the repository, `git clone https://github.com/Cobertos/VisualsSandbox`
2. Open it as a Unity project

If assets are missing (they shouldn't), put in an issue and check the `.gitignore` as I will only distribute assets that are mine.


### Contributing
